<h1>Web Dev Bio: Willard Torres II</h1>
<!--Describe myself and my (totally fictional) experience as a web developer-->
<article class="intro">
<p> Hello there. My name is Willard Torres II. I am a professional web developer, having started back in 2016.
 I've had a deep interest in studying the use of technology on a daily basis, focusing my studies on the creation of the many websites we have grown to use for our personal needs.
 Since beginning my career, I have worked on creating various types of websites for numerous businesses.
 You will find that I am quite skilled in analyzing and debugging the code used to generate the content of a website.</p>
